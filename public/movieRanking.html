<h1>Best movies list according to Samurai</h1>
    <h2>Top 3 greatest of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. 3 Idiots</h3>
<p>
    This was the first movie that I watched in movie theater and at that time I didn't understood the meaning <br />
    or the messege it wanted to deliver but I sitll enjoyed the movie and it became my favourite movie.<br />
</p>

<h3>2. The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>
    The story, the dialogues, the acting, and the cinmatography were all perfect.<br />
    This movie gave the greatest joker of all time played by Late actor Heath Ledger.<br />
    Christian Bale also became an iconic Batman, and in my opinion he is the best actor to play The Batman.<br />
</p>

<h3>3. Spiderman Trilogy by Sam Raimi</h3>
<p>
    I know this is not a single movie but an entire series of movie but they are perfect together.<br />
    This Trilogy series made my childhood memorable and whenever I watch an edit on these movies on <br />
    either instagram or youtube it just hit like nostalgia.<br />
